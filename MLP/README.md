# MLP GDP Prediction Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use a MLP model to predict GDP (Gross Domestic Product) values for a given country. The MLP model is implemented using the TensorFlow Keras library, and the data is prepared using Pandas and scikit-learn.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python:** The code requires Python programming language to be installed on your system.
2. **Libraries:** The following Python libraries should be installed - pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow.


## Prerequisites

- pip install -r requirements.txt

- Load Data: The code loads yearly time series GDP data from the 'merged_data.csv' file using Pandas. Make sure you have the 'merged_data.csv' file in the same directory as the notebook.

- Sort Data: The data is sorted in ascending order based on the 'Year' column using the 'sort_values' function.

Prepare MLP Input: The 'create_sequences' function is used to create input sequences and labels for each column. The window size for the MLP model is defined as 'window_length'. The function converts the data into sequences of 'window_length' time steps, where each sequence corresponds to a specific label.

- Normalize Data: The input sequences and labels are normalized using Min-Max scaling to ensure that all values are in the range [0, 1].

- Model Training
Split Data: The data is split into training and testing sets using the 'train_test_split' function from scikit-learn.

- MLP Model: A sequential model with an MLP layer and a Dense layer is created using the TensorFlow Keras library. The model is compiled with the 'mean_squared_error' loss function and 'adam' optimizer.

- MLPRegressor: Additionally, an MLPRegressor model from scikit-learn is used as a comparison for prediction.

- Train the Model: The MLP model is trained on the training data for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32. A validation split of 0.1 is used during training.

- Evaluation
Mean Squared Error: The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is calculated to evaluate the performance of the MLP model on the test data. 

- Prediction for Canada: The MLP model is used to predict GDP values for Canada. The input sequences are created for Canada's GDP data, and the MLPRegressor model is used for prediction.(MSE=0.0004)

- Visualization: The original and predicted GDP values for Canada are visualized using matplotlib.

> [!NOTE]
> The code uses a fixed window size ('window_length') for the MLP model. You can experiment with different window sizes to see how it affects the model's performance.
> If you want to use data for other countries, ensure that you have the corresponding GDP data in the 'merged_data.csv' file or update the code to load data from a different CSV file.
> This code provides a basic implementation of MLP for GDP prediction. For real-world applications, consider further optimizations, hyperparameter tuning, and more sophisticated MLP architectures.
